# Spooky.Best (Initial Source) Leak
**Initial** Source leak for Spooky.best mod menu. The Spooky project was made after the towel was thrown in for SpookiMystic which was originally based out of nano42 and as you can see the later versions as well as the "new" menu has been made using big base v1. When Spooky first released it was pretty stripped down from the original version, a lot of the features were commented out, you can compare the current features and updated ones with the originals. It is pretty standard, not a lot of hooks or really any outstanding features or protections, it was made for the simple users but seemingly overpriced originally. So obviously when it was given there were more features than what they released but it ended up being stripped down a lot. There are some detected things like the "stealth" in there. 

## Why?
I'm really tired of keeping this on my pc, and I really want nothing more to do with it, the people, etc. There were a lot of arguements and claims that were made and a lot of uneeded hostility which turned into threatening the source to abate conflicts which in itself is kind of toxic, so at this point it's just better to get rid of and forget it. Don't ask me for credits I'm  not sure who added, what was added to and by whom and when or for what reason or at what version...etc. I'm just releasing it because technically I had ownership of it, consider it a self leak of a conglomeration of a master of work(s).

_**Version At Release:**_ Patch 1.50

## What May Need Updated?
* Crossmaps
* Reclass structs
* Events and Protections
